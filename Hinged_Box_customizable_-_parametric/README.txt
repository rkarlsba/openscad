# Summary

Do you carry small things around in your backpack? Like keys, earphones, pens or pencils, USB-stick, cardreader, flashlight. And are always struggling to find what you want?
Or perhaps you always have small stuff lying around on your desk, cluttering up your desk space?

Here is a fully parametric, customizable box design, created in OpenSCAD to solve this problem. Now you can easily store away all these little things in a custom made box.
Once printed in your favourite color and size, you can clean up both your bag, desk, suitcase or even conveniently store away all that small stuff in a unique 3D printed box. You can even add your own text on the front or on the lid.

Print long boxes for pens, pencils, small screwdrivers, pointers.
Print small boxes for your USB-sticks, square ones for your SD-cards and/or cardreader.
Print a flat box for small presents. Or print bigger ones to store away drill bits, bolts and nuts etc. etc.
