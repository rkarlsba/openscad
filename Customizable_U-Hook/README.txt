# Summary

Parametric hook, universal and very strong.

I’ve been looking a while for a parametric hook modeling, but I didn’t found any available model that ideally combines strength and customizing possibilities. So I tried to create the model I wanted. This is an attempt for a universal and very strong parametric hook, easily 3D printable ﻿as a "finished product".

I did a "stress test" with my parametric U-Hook in its default configuration. The hook had been printed in PLA, with 2 perimeters, 0.2 mm layer height, and 20% infill. 
It supported a weight of 47,4 Kg.

Full documentation available as a PDF (in English and French) in the ﻿"Thing Files" section, or on my website :

To customize this object, you can use Thingiverse's Customizer, or OpenScad software (free and open-source). 

OpenScad is very easy to use if you just want to customize an existing SCAD file. I wrote a little tutorial about "how to use a parametric file", that explain how to use OpenScad to customize a parametric object :
