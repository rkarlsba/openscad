Celtic Knot Library for Openscad
================================

API is still in development and is likely to change
---------------------------------------------------

Feedback very welcome

My son wanted a celtic knot bracelet.  This library was used to create
my first attempt.  The knots look like:

![example knots](https://github.com/beanz/celtic-knot-scad/raw/master/doc/knots.jpg "Example Knots")

The library provides two interfaces.  The first API uses large knot
parts (called pieces in the code) and looks like:

    knot([ "<~>",
           "!&;",
           "[-]" ], tile_width = 5);

where the first parameter is an kind of ASCII art for the desired
pattern and ```tile_width``` is the knot tile size.  The "alphabet" for
pieces is generated by ```knot-piece-alphabet.scad``` and looks like:

![Knot Piece Alphabet](https://github.com/beanz/celtic-knot-scad/raw/master/doc/piece-alphabet.jpg "Knot Piece Alphabet")

Each pieces is a 2x2 square of smaller knot parts (called tiles in the
code).  However, edge and corner pieces have some empty tiles.

The second API uses knot tiles and looks like:

    fine_knot([ "<rq>",
                "AtYF",
                "EGhW",
                "[sd]" ], tile_width = 5);

where the first parameter is an ASCII art for the desired pattern and
```tile_width``` is the knot tile size.

The "alphabet" for tiles is generated by ```knot-tile-alphabet.scad``` and
looks like:
