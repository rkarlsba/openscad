# Summary

Great Scott! It's a mini version of the flux capacitor from Back to the Future. The parts can be printed in any colors but for movie accuracy the top and bottom should be grey or silver, the hose clamps should be red and the injectors should be clear or glow-in-the-dark. Combine the 3D printed parts with a CR2032 3V battery, three 5mm 3V clear LEDs and three 38 mm long sections of ethernet cord (yellow for movie accuracy).
Plug the LEDs into the sockets making sure the positive (longer) leg is in left slot. The negative (shorter) leg should bend down and rest under the battery. The positive leg will bend down on top of the battery. Plug the injectors into the three pins above the LEDs. Plug one end of the ethernet cable into the hose clamps and the other end into the holes on the case bottom. The hose clamps should fit on top of the three towers in the case bottom and the top should fit loosely on.
